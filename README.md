# Special_Year_Finder
searches for special years based on some unique algorithms using modulo operators

This program expands on a napkin calculation I made earlier. I was just curious how many years had similar properties.

The initial calculation I made was:

2016 % 9 = 0
2016 % 8 = 0
2016 % 7 = 0
2016 % 6 = 0
2016 % 5 = 1
2016 % 4 = 0
2016 % 3 = 0
2016 % 2 = 0
2016 % 1 = 0 \\obviously this is always true
If you read this number in binary from 9 to 1, you get 000010000
Which when read in binary is the number 16.
2016 % 16 = 0

This was pretty remarkable, so I wanted to find the rest of them.

There is a integer variable at the beginning called endYear that is currently set to 10000.
This is the best place to change the scope of the years to search. I tried 100000000, and there were some
  of the higher base numbers that were not found. My laptop battery is dying, so I didn't want to do the
  calculation any higher.
  
It turns out that this calculation I stumbled upon for our current year is pretty unique. We are the only
  people to have ever lived during it. (at least during AD years) The next year with similar qualities won't
  happen for another five thousand years or so.

Some would say there are a lot of interesting things about this year, including spiritually. I've noticed a
  significant difference in this year compared to previous ones, so take from it what you will.

This was just a fun project that my mind got stuck on. I hope you like it!
